**INTRODUCTION :

The Scientific calculator project is the application based mini project,

which is used to perform arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions,

exponential functions, radian to degree conversion, and degree to radian conversion and so on.

These calculators are widely used in the field of science, technology and mathematics. The tool

used for writing the code in this project is visual studio code. This project has multi file and

multiplatform approach (Linux and Windows).

# RESEARCH:

 Modern scientific calculators generally have many more features than a standard four or
 five-function calculator, and the feature set differs between manufacturers and models
 however, the defining features of a scientific calculator include:

scientific notation

floating-point arithmetic

logarithmic functions, using both base 10 and base e

trigonometric functions (some including hyperbolic trigonometry)

exponential functions and roots beyond the square root

quick access to constants such as pi and e

In addition, high-end scientific calculators generally include:

hexadecimal, binary, and octal calculations, including basic Boolean mathematics
complex numbers

fractions calculations

statistics and probability calculations

programmability — see Programmable calculator

equation solving

 matrix calculations

calculus

letters that can be used for spelling words or including variables into an equation

conversion of units.

**Defining_System:

Design and testing mathematical operations of scientific calculator using unit

testing algorithm.

**SWOT_analysis:

Strengths:Innovative, User-friendly.

Weakness: Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.

Opportunities: We know that we mostly use scientific calculators in our childhood. So tech based

market always attracts the youth.

Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.
